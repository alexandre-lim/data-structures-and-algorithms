This repository aims to be a companion to the book [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://pragprog.com/titles/jwdsal2/a-common-sense-guide-to-data-structures-and-algorithms-second-edition/) by **Jay Wengrow.** I rewrote most of the data structures and algorithms found in the book in **Typescript.** Practicing what you read is another way to learn. I made it for myself and decided to share it publicly.

**It's not production-ready. The tests are not exhaustive. They are mostly there for documentation on how to use things.** It's a just start to dig deeper into data structures and algorithms.

There's no context. If you want to know more, you can find my [notes](https://www.alexandrelim.com/books/a-common-sense-guide-to-data-structures-and-algorithms-87b0acc8-4511-4b94-8cd5-2020d3e68990) that may spark your interest in reading the book.

Many thanks to Jay Wengrow, who allowed me to share my notes and this repository! :pray:
